//! class OperationSmallAddition  Class containing information about the power operation between the *Small classes.

/*!
  @author Samuel Quinodoz <samuel.quinodoz@epfl.ch>

  This class only contains information that can be usefull in a templated framework (such as the
  one for assembling the algebraic systems via expressions).

  It cannot be instanciated, neither the generic definition nor the specializations (private constructors
  and destructor only).

  The only information stored in this class is the type of the result. For example, as the addition
  of a LifeV::Real with a LifeV::Real is a LifeV::Real as well, the specialization
  LifeV::OperationSmallAddition<LifeV::Real,LifeV::Real> contains the typedef result_Type that aliases
  the LifeV::Real type.
