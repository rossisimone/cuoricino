//! MonolithicBlockComposed - Class handling block-structured preconditioners
/*!
    @author Paolo Crosetto
    see \cite CrosettoEtAl2009

    Pure virtual class which is suited for handling a block-structured matrix that can be written as a
    multiplication of a variable number of factors. It contains a vector of pointers for each factor, BCHandler, FESpace
    and for each coupling part.

    It can be used e.g. to build preconditioners for the FSI system which are composed of different factors.
    It derives from the pure virtual class MonolithicBlock, it is still pure virtual and it is intended to be the base
    class for every preconditioner that can be split into factors. Notice that the vector of the preconditioned factors
    is missing, because it has to be implemented in the children. It could be for instance of type
    ComposedOperator<T> or PreconditionerComposed.
