//! MonolithicRobinInterface - Class for the Robin coupling of etherogeneaous problems
/*!
    @author Paolo Crosetto

    This class is a base interface for the monolithic Robin coupling of 2 problems. A coupled Dirichlet-Neumann problem
    can be transformed into a Robin one by inheriting from this class. The allocation of the memory for M_robinCoupling
    has to be done outside.

    The Robin conditions are obtained algebraically through linear combination of the lines corresponding to the Dirichlet and Neumann
    coupling conditions already present in the matrix. This is achieved by multiplying the matrix times a restriction
    matrix (M_robinCoupling) which performs the restriction to the interface and the linear combination. Then the result
    is summed to the original matrix. The update of the rhs vector must be done outside this class.

    \todo Remove this class and try to implement the same coupling otherwise.
