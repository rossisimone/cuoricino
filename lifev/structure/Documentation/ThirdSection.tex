\section{The StructuralSolver framework}
In this section the \SSol framework is described. In particular, after a brief overview of the main features of this solver for structural mechanic problems, a detailed description of the practical implementation of the different constitutive laws is presented. In section \ref{sct-Continuum} and \ref{sct-FEF} we have provided the complete expression for the first Piola Kirchhoff tensor and its linearization. In this part of the report, each of the terms that appear in the definition of \Piola and its Jacobian, for each material law, is associated with one specific method in the new \SSolNC framework. This should help the users to work with this framework and, if needed, to reuse part of the existing code if a new constitutive law has to be inserted in \LV.\\
The \SSolNC framework has been developed in order to have a unique solver for structural dynamic problems. The main characters which have been introduced are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the \textit{StructuralSolver} class,
  \item the \textit{StructuralMaterial} class, with the definitions of the constitutive laws,
  \item the \textit{AssemblyElementalStructure} \texttt{namespace}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \textit{StructuralSolver} class}
This class is the solver of the structural mechanic problem. It has been developed according to the common design pattern used for other solvers in \LV. According to this, its main three methods are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tPC{buildSystem()},
  \item \tPC{updateSystem()},
  \item \tPC{iterate()}.
\end{itemize}
The first builds the mass matrix \mass (which is constant for all the time steps). The second one update the right hand side of the system \eqref{eq::GeneralSystem} and the last solves the nonlinear system:
\begin{equation}
  \LE\left(\vectL^{n+1}\right)=0
  \label{eq::Root}
\end{equation}
The \tPC{iterate} method contains the Newton method applied to \eqref{eq::Root}. The three main steps of the Newton method are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item evaluating the residual using the displacement field at the iteration $k$ of the Newton method. This stage is implemented in \tPC{StructuralSolver::evalResidual()};
  \item updating the Jacobian using the displacement field at the current iteration $k$. It is implemented in \tPC{StructuralSolver::updateJacobian()};
  \item solving the linearized system. The method \tPC{StructuralSolver::solveJacobian()} implements this stage.
\end{itemize}
In order to solve the mathematical problem \eqref{eq::MathProb}, this solver communicates with three main classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tPC{StructuralMaterial},
  \item \tPC{VenantKirchhoffElasticData},
  \item \tPC{TimeAdvance}.
\end{itemize}
The \tPC{StructuralMaterial} class defines the constitutive law which is used during the simulation. The second class contains the mechanical parameters of the material (e.g. Young modulus, Poisson ratio) and some useful variables set in the data file of the simulation. The last class, as anticipated in \ref{sct-Linear}, manages the time advancing procedure and it is not described here.\\

\subsection{The \textit{StructuralMaterial} class}
This is the core of the new framework. It has been designed to be a general interface between all the material models and the solver class. In this way, the different structural models can be used in a very flexible way just changing a variable, called solidType, in the data file.\\
For this reason, from the practical point of view, this class is a factory (see \cite{DesignPattern}). It has only virtual methods and the most important are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tPC{computeStiffness()},
  \item \tPC{updateJacobianMatrix()}.
\end{itemize}
Since they are pure virtual methods, in each class corresponding to a structural model there is the specific implementation of the two methods above according to the chosen law.\\
The method \tPC{computeStiffness()} computes, using the displacement fields at the iteration $k$ of the Newton method, the stiffness vector when the solver class has to evaluate the residual in \tPC{evalResidual()}. The second method provides to StructuralSolver the Jacobian matrix of \Piola.\\ 

\subsection{The \textit{AssemblyElementalStructure} \texttt{namespace}}
As it will be shown later on, lots of new methods have been developed to compute all the terms of the first Piola-Kirchhoff tensor and its Jacobian for all the material models.
\AES is a new namespace defined in \LV. Its creation was necessary in order to keep all these new methods separated from the ones which had been previously developed (for different purposes) and grouped in the AssemblyElemental namespace. Few methods, which were already available in \LV in AssemblyElemental have been kept and not doubled in the new namespace. When those methods are used, the interested reader may refer to their definition in the AssemblyElemental namespace in \tPC{AssemblyElemental.hpp}.\\
As it can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig::design}, \AES is used only by the classes of the material laws, that is where \Piola and the Jacobian are computed.



\subsection{Implementation of the different constitutive relations}
In this section we give a detailed description of the implementation of the structural models. All the methods in the following receive some arguments from the class that calls them. Here we will neglect all of them. The interested reader may refer directly to their implementation to have more details on this.


\subsubsection{The St. Venant-Kirchhoff model}
This model is implemented in \tPC{VenantKirchhoffMaterialNonLinear.hpp}. We will refer to Eq. \eqref{eq::SVK-P-displ} for the definitions of the methods.\\
The correspondance between the terms in Eq. \eqref{eq::SVK-P-displ} and their implementation is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda(\diver{\displL})\I$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_div},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\big(\delOp\displL + \delOp\displL^T\big)$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_strain},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{2}\big(\delOp\displL:\delOp\displL\big)$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_derdiv},
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda\big(\diver{\displL}\big)\delOp\displL$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_divgrad},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{2}\big(\delOp\displL:\delOp\displL\big)\delOp\displL$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgrad},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\big(\delOp\displL^T \delOp\displL\big)$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergradbis},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\displL\big(\delOp\displL\delOp\displL^T\big)$ is splitted into the sum of two members. The first one corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis.} The second is \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis\_Tr},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\displL\delOp\displL^T\delOp\displL$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgradTr\_gradbis}.
\end{itemize}
The definition of the Jacobian on \Piola is given in Eq. \eqref{eq::SVK-Jacobian}. Here we specify the implementations of the terms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda(\delOp\cdot\delta\Spost)$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_div},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu(\delOp\delta\Spost + (\delOp\delta\Spost)^T)$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_strain},
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda\delOp\Spost:\delOp\delta\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_derdiv},  
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda(\delOp\cdot\Spost)\delOp\delta\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_divgrad},
  \item $\displaystyle \lambda(\delOp\cdot\delta\Spost)\delOp\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_divgrad\_2},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{2}(\delOp\delta\Spost:\delOp\Spost)\delOp\Spost$ and the term $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{2}(\delOp\Spost:\delOp\delta\Spost)\delOp\Spost$ are added up in \tPC{stiff\_gradgrad\_2},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\lambda}{2}(\delOp\Spost:\delOp\Spost)\delOp\delta\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgrad},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu(\delOp\Spost)^{\text{T}}\delOp\delta\Spost$ and the term  $\displaystyle \mu(\delOp\delta\Spost)^{\text{T}}\delOp\Spost$ are added up and implemented in \tPC{stiff\_dergrad},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\Spost\delOp\delta\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\delta\Spost\delOp\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis\_2},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\Spost(\delOp\delta\Spost)^{\text{T}}$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis\_Tr},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\delta\Spost(\delOp\Spost)^{\text{T}}$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_dergrad\_gradbis\_Tr\_2},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\delta\Spost(\delOp\Spost)^{\text{T}}\delOp\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgradTr\_gradbis\_3},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\Spost(\delOp\delta\Spost)^{\text{T}}\delOp\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgradTr\_gradbis\_2},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu\delOp\Spost(\delOp\Spost)^{\text{T}}\delOp\delta\Spost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_gradgradTr\_gradbis}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The Linear Elastic model}
This constitutive law is defined in \tPC{VenantKirchhoffMaterialLinear.hpp}. We recall the definition of \Piola as a function of the displacement field, Eq. \eqref{eq::LE-P}.\\
Herein there is the list of the correspondances:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\lambda(\diver{\displL})\I$ corresponds to the method \tPC{stiff\_div};
  \item $\mu\big(\delOp\displL + \delOp\displL^T\big)$ corresponds to the method \tPC{stiff\_strain}.
\end{itemize}
In the case of linear elastic model, the Jacobian of \Piola is the tensor itself and for this reason it is not specified. The methods listed above belong to the AssemblyElemental namespace since this constitutive law was already available in \LV before the creation of the \SSolNC framework. 


\subsubsection{The Neohookean model}
The first Piola-Kirchhoff tensor is defined in Eq. \eqref{eq::NH-P}. The terms have been implemented in different methods as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle \mu J^{-\frac{2}{3}}\left(\F-\frac{1}{3}I_{\C}\F^{-T}\right)$ in the method \tPC{source\_P1iso\_NH},
  \item $\displaystyle J\frac{\kappa}{2}\left(J-1+\frac{1}{J}\text{ln}J\right)\F^{-T}$ in the method \tPC{source\_Pvol}.
\end{itemize}
Concering the Jacobian, defined in Eqs. \eqref{eq::IsoPartDP-neo} and \eqref{eq::VolPartDP-neo}, the implementation for the isochoric part has been done has follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle -\frac{2}{3}J^{-\frac{5}{3}}\left(\cofF:\GradSpost\right)\F$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_NH\_1term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}\mu J^{-2}I_{\C}\left(\cofF:\GradSpost\right)\cofF$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_NH\_2term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}\mu J^{-\frac{5}{3}}\left(\F:\GradSpost\right)\cofF$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_NH\_3term},
  \item $\displaystyle \mu J^{-\frac{2}{3}}\GradSpost$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_NH\_4term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\mu}{3}J^{-2}I_{\C}\cofF\GradSpost^T\cofF$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_NH\_5term}.
\end{itemize}
For the volumetric part, these methods have been created:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\kappa}{2}\left(2J^2-J+1\right)\left[\F^{-T}:\GradSpost\right]\F^{-T}$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_Pvol\_1term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\kappa}{2}\left(J-J^2-\text{ln}(J)\right)\F^{-T}\GradSpost^T\F^{-T}$ in \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_Pvol\_2term}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The Exponential model}
In this case we analyze only the isochoric part of \Piola (Eq. \eqref{eq::EXP-P}). It is composed only by one term,
\begin{displaymath}
\displaystyle \alpha J^{-\frac{2}{3}}\left(\F-\frac{1}{3}I_{\C}\F^{-T}\right)e^{\gamma\big(I_{\C}-3\big)},
\end{displaymath}
and it has been implemented in the method \tPC{source\_P1iso\_Exp}.
The correspondance between the terms of the isochoric part of the Jacobian (Eq. \eqref{eq::IsoPartDP-exp}) and their own implementations in AssemblyElementalStructure is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\displaystyle -\frac{2}{3}\alpha\term J^{-\frac{5}{3}}\left(1+\gamma I_{\C}\right)\left[\cofF:\GradSpost\right]\F$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_1term},
  \item $\displaystyle 2\alpha\gamma\term J ^{-\frac{4}{3}}\left(\F:\GradSpost\right)\F$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_2term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}\alpha\term J^{-2}I_{\C}\left(1+\gamma I_{\C}\right)\left(\cofF:\GradSpost\right)\cofF$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_3term},
  \item $\displaystyle -\frac{2}{3}\alpha\term J^{-\frac{5}{3}}\left(1+\gamma I_{\C}\right)\left(\F:\GradSpost\right)\cofF$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_4term},
  \item $\displaystyle \alpha\term J^{-\frac{2}{3}}\GradSpost$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_5term},
  \item $\displaystyle \frac{\alpha}{3}\term J^{-2}I_{\C}\cofF\GradSpost^T\cofF$ corresponds to \tPC{stiff\_Jac\_P1iso\_Exp\_6term}.
\end{itemize}
The volumetric part in both the first Piola-Kirchhoff tensor and in its Jacobian, is the same for the Neohookean and Exponential model. For this reason, it has not been specified here.
