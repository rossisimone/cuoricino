   @section intro Tutorial to deal with a mesh within LifeV
   This tutorial describes how to:
   <ol>
    <li>create a 3D mesh
    <li>read a 3D mesh
    <li>build extra data like edges and faces
    <li>check the validity of the mesh
    </ol>

    \dontinclude test_mesh.cpp

    @subsection constructor Create the mesh

    First we define a mesh structure, here it is a 3D mesh formed by quadratic tetrahedras,
    it is done like this:
    \skipline RegionMesh

    @subsection io Reading the mesh

    Meshes can be imported from two formats : mesh++ and inria.
    Here is how it is done with mesh++:
    \skipline  readMppFile(aMesh,fname, m);

    @subsection check Checking the mesh
    To check the validity of the mesh, do the following:
    \skipline aMesh.check(0,true,true);

    @subsection show Showing information about the mesh

    To show some information and statistics about the mesh,
    \skipline showMe

    @subsection build Building the mesh

    To build the local edges and faces,
    \skip updateElementEdges()
    \until updateElementFaces()

    To clean the local edges and faces,
    \skip cleanElementEdges()
    \until cleanElementFaces()

    To build all edges
    \skip bedges
    \until true);

    To build all faces
    \skip bfaces
    \until true);
