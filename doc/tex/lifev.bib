  journal = {Communications in Applied and Industrial Mathematics},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {Subsurface flow is influenced by the heterogeneity of the porous medium
    and in particular by the presence of faults and large fractures which
    act as preferential paths for the flow. In this work we present a
    robust numerical method for the simulation of two- phase Darcy flows
    in heterogeneous media and propose a possible treatment of fractures
    by means of the extended finite element method, XFEM, and the coupling
    with a reduced model for the flow inside the fracture. The use of
    extended finite elements allows to handle fractures that are non
    conforming with the underlying mesh, thus increasing the applicability
    of the proposed scheme to the simulation of realistic problems such
    as oil migration in fractured basins, CO2 storage or pollutant dispersion
    in groundwater flows.},
